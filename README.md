# miniature-tribble
## Setup
Welcome to NNMG's Project MT (miniature-tribble)! You do NOT need to understand every single line of code to be able to contribute. 
Half of the files and scripts are the LibGDX framework itself; I don't understand what it means either. 
To start, clone this repository. Next, download IntelliJ IDEA https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/. The Community Edition is sufficient. 
Once you do this, go to File -> Open and open the build.gradle file from the repository you cloned.<br/>

It will ask you if you want to open the whole project; do this. Once it builds, you'll notice a whole bunch of folders and files.
We can ignore most of them and go straight to this:<br/>

When the game runs, it goes from Main -> MainMenuScreen -> GameScreen <-> BattleScreen. This should be self-explanatory. 
The last thing you'll need to start coding is a proper run configuration (for at least Desktop). Learn how to do that here:
